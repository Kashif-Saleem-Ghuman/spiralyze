                as part of a social network, a neighborhood, and a community. Service providers and policymakers must
                consider that a lack of sense of purpose can become problematic as people age. Engaging them in leisure

                manner (meaning that they want to exchange their services and skills with others for the mutual benefit
                of the neighborhood or community). Qualitative and quantitative studies published from 2005 to 2016
                examining the social needs of older adults were eligible for inclusion. </p>
